## Welcome

This is a basic Next.js application that lets users log in using:

- Credentials (email and password)
- Google
- GitHub

I've used MongoDB for storing the users and accounts. In the code, I've written lots of comments to make it easy to understand what each part does, helpful for anyone looking at it later.

## What I used

Authentication: [Next Auth](https://next-auth.js.org/)

Toast notifications: [react-hot-toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/)

Styling: [TailwindCSS](tailwindcss.com) (I also used their sign in form component)
